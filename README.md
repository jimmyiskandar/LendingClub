# LendingClub
## Context:  
### Lending Club is a meeting place between borrowers and investors. Borrowers petition to borrow money and they disclose their financial qualification, while investors make  decision whether to loan their money judging from the borrowers’ financial qualification. Risky borrowers will have to pay higher interest rate, while safe borrowers pay lower interest rate.

## Objective:
### Investors at Lending Club  lose money when borrowers fail to make payment. There are few leading indicators to warn them. The goal is to identify best practices for investors to avoid delinquent loans and achieve high return. 

## Analysis:
### There are a number of factors that investors need to take into consideration. Among all factors, the above three factors—grade,  homeownership, and year the load issued—show differentiation between delinquent and current loans.  The latter shows that delinquency is correlated with the overall economic performance.

## Recommendation:
### Investors are advised to stay with homeowners with grade risk 0 (A) or 1 (B), but they pay low interest rate. The current economic climate also plays a role. Other factors, such as, higher annual income, higher FICO score, long years of employment, and lower monthly debt income ratio are preferred, however they are not decisive enough. Hence, it is recommended to build a classification model to predict loan delinquency as well as to build a portfolio mix in order to produce high return.
